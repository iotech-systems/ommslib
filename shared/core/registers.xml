    <!-- active power or real power
        Active power is the power which is actually consumed or utilized in an AC Circuit is
        called True power or Active Power or real power. It is measured in kilowatt (kW) or MW.
        It is the actual outcomes of the electrical system which runs the electric circuits or load.

    <!-- APPARENT POWER (KVA): Kilo Volt Ampere is the measure of apparent power in ac circuit.
        It used to rate how much power the supply can deliver. KVA is usually used to rate sources
        such as transformers, generators, UPS etc. It is also called imaginary power. The actual power(KW)
        consumed by the loads connected in a circuit can be obtained by multiplying apparent
        power(KVA) with power factor. It can be expressed in complex form as:
            apparent power(KVA) = active power(KW) + reactive power

    <!-- REACTIVE POWER(KVAr): Reactive power is the imaginary part of apparent power when it is
        expressed in complex form. If the load in an ac circuit is only resistive the power will always
        flow from source to load. If reactive loads (inductor or capacitor) connected in ac circuit it causes
        reactive power to develop in the circuit. The reactive power is continually bounces back and forth
        between the source & load. It represents the energy that is first stored and then released in the magnetic
        field of the inductor, or in the electric field of a capacitor connected in the circuit. Since
        reactive power bounces back and forth between source and load it does not provide any energy to
        the load and draws more current from mains so more heat loss take place on the circuit lines. The
        reactive power can be reduced by increasing the power factor (reducing the phase angle). This can be
        achieved by providing a designed capacitive bank in the circuit.
